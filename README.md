# Task-Dependency-Scheduler
:

📌 Task Dependency Scheduler
A university project built during an AI course (2024), where I led a team to develop a CLI-based task management tool using Python and graph algorithms.

This project helped us explore real applications of DFS, cycle detection, and topological sorting using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) — while also building an interactive experience that manages tasks, dependencies, priorities, and deadlines.

🚀 Features
Add / Edit / Delete Tasks

Assign:

Dependencies (edges in the DAG)

Priorities (0–10)

Deadlines (with validation)

Descriptions

Graph Algorithms Used:

DFS – to traverse tasks

Cycle Detection – to ensure valid scheduling

Topological Sort – for correct task execution order

Visualization of the task graph (with NetworkX & Matplotlib)

🛠 Technologies
Python 3

NetworkX

Matplotlib

CLI (Command Line Interface)

🤖 Built For
AI Course – Faculty of Computers and AI
2024 (Egyption Chinese University)
I was the project leader, collaborating with classmates to deliver this.

⚠️ Notes
This project was done 1 year ago — but I’m bringing it back as part of a personal challenge to revive and showcase my older projects.

You can also check out the Restaurant Recommender System I posted recently ([link it once it's up](https://github.com/z3yad30/oop-restaurant-system)).

📂 How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install networkx matplotlib
python scheduler.py
Follow the CLI prompts to add/edit/manage tasks with dependencies.

📚 Future Ideas
Add GUI with Tkinter or Streamlit

Save/load graphs (persistence)

Export schedules to PDF/CSV

Add color-coded priorities in visualization
